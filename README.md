# **Purchase Comparison: Cash vs. Installments**

## **Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to provide a simple and effective financial analysis tool to help consumers decide whether it is more advantageous to buy a product in cash or in installments. The system will calculate the total cost for both payment options, taking into account factors such as the product's price, the installment interest rate, and the number of installments. Additionally, the system will calculate the profitability of each option, so users can determine which option results in greater savings.

## **How It Works**

The system takes into account the following variables:

- **Product Price**: The original price of the product being purchased.
- **Cash Price**: The price of the product when paid entirely upfront, with no interest charges.
- **Number of Installments**: The number of payments the consumer plans to make.
- **Monthly Interest Rate**: The interest rate applied per month on the installment payments.

## **Calculation Process**

1. **Total Cash Payment Calculation**: 
   - The cash payment option does not incur any additional charges, so the final cost is exactly the original price of the product.

2. **Total Installment Payment Calculation**:
   - To calculate the final cost for the installment option, we use the compound interest formula, considering the monthly interest rate and the number of installments. The final amount will be the sum of all monthly installments over the entire payment period.

3. **Profitability Calculation**:
   - The profitability will be calculated as the difference between the total amount paid in the installment option and the amount paid in cash. Additionally, if the cash amount was invested instead of being spent, the system will calculate the potential return that could be achieved during the installment period.

4. **Comparison**:
   - After performing the calculations, the system will compare which option is more advantageous: paying in cash or paying in installments. The comparison considers the amount of interest paid in the installment option and the potential return on investment if the cash price had been invested.

## **Practical Example**

Let's assume the product costs **R$ 1,000.00** and the consumer has the option to pay:

- **Cash**: R$ 1,000.00
- **Installments**: 12 installments with a 2% monthly interest rate.

The system will calculate the total amount paid in installments and show the savings obtained by paying in cash. It will also calculate how much return the user could earn by investing R$ 1,000.00 during the 12-month installment period, comparing the final costs of each option.

## **Expected Output**

At the end of the calculation, the system will present:

- The difference in amounts between the cash and installment options.
- The return the user would have obtained by investing the cash amount.
- Which option is more financially advantageous.
- A terminal graph comparing the two options.

## **Comparison Graph**

Finally, the project will generate a simple graph showing:

- The total amount paid in cash.
- The total amount paid in installments.
- The profitability obtained by investing the cash.

This graph will help the user clearly understand which option offers the best cost-benefit.
